# Naive-Bayes-Classifier
Constructed a Naive Bayes Classifier from scratch to classify if given test samples in the form seen in pop_vs_classical_test.csv 
belonged to classical or pop songs. The model worked really well and had high accuracy at around 97%. The second stage involved 10 different genres and 
this is where the model started to decrease in accuracy but still managed to hang around 50%. All my results and findings can be found in Assignment 1.pdf
